Its not about a expensive hourly rate,
I just value my overtime with 12 years of experience with Magento 1 & Magento 2 on daily basis.

Over the years Iâ€™ve completed over 1000+ Magento projects for various
clients covering all Magento aspects.

I always try to avoid mistakes about project that I accept and never compete with my clients because its out of mind to compete with honest people who pay nice and they are willing to pay more,
just to make sure business is running and all sides are happy.

So I have decided to help that nice people to have all their creativity and imagination,
completed on because believe or not, most of businesses that get their shop delivered before everyone else they are on top today.
I find my self relaxing doing great things helping people to earn, that changed my life.
Next to that I also covered number of other WordPress, PHP, Custom MVC projects.
An ambitious problem solver with a passion for online businesses who would like
to join a team of like-minded developers.
My experience includes creating logical and innovative solutions to complex problems.

I am a Full Stack Developer, with twelve years of massive proven web development experience, focused on e-commerce.
